### ‚Äì The Riemann Hypothesis as a Symmetry Theorem ‚Äì  

#### A Phase-Angle Based Visualization of Œ∂(s) across œÉ  

**Code name: OOL-KND-RHST-2025**

üìÖ *This project was unveiled on April 1st, 2025 ‚Äî a **Prime Day** (20250401).*  
Coincidentally, it was also April Fool's Day ‚Äî *the only day where lies and truth are allowed to meet.*

This project is an experimental collaboration between **AI and human intuition**,  
focused on exploring and attempting to prove the legendary **Riemann Hypothesis**.

The goal is not only to solve the theorem, but also to explore how **intuition, insight, and symbolic computation**  
can be enhanced by AI to tackle deeply complex mathematical challenges.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Gentle but Firm Warning

- This repository contains a high density of what may be considered **spoilers** to the Riemann Hypothesis.
- If you are a scholar who dislikes IT, generative AI, or unconventional approaches ‚Äî please turn back now.
- We do not wish to spoil the **joy of discovery** for those who want to reach the truth *by their own hands*.
- The act of unraveling the universe's mysteries by oneself is, after all, the **supreme intellectual delight**.
- What you find here is *only one possible answer* ‚Äî and you're not allowed to peek until you feel you've hit a wall.

## Overview

The **Riemann Hypothesis** is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.  
Its resolution would impact number theory, cryptography, physics, and many other fields.

This project investigates the RH by combining:

- AI-assisted mathematical reasoning and visualization
- human-driven insight, abstraction, and intuition

It aims not merely to chase a solution, but to **explore the mysteries hidden within numbers themselves**.

## Introduction

The Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is a central tool in complex analysis and number theory.  
It serves as a window into the inner nature of ‚Äúnumber.‚Äù

The hypothesis posits that **all non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$** lie on the so-called **Critical Line**:

$$
\mathrm{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Prime numbers, as the fundamental building blocks of arithmetic, appear throughout mathematics and science ‚Äî  
and the mysterious distribution of primes is reflected in the **location of these zeros**.

---

## üìú Formal Statement of the Riemann Hypothesis

> *"All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line."*

Mathematically expressed:

$$
\forall \rho \in \mathbb{C},\quad
\left( \zeta(\rho) = 0\ \wedge\ 0 < \mathrm{Re}(\rho) < 1 \right)
\Rightarrow \mathrm{Re}(\rho) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

## üîç Selected Highlights from the Research

### üåÄ OOL-pi-jump-00: Phase Flip at Zero Points (¬±œÄ Jump)

![œÉ=0.500](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.50.png)  
*Figure: œÉ = 0.500, t = 14.135 ‚Äî a non-trivial zero*

At first glance, this phase graph seems smooth and uneventful.  
But it actually reveals a deep phenomenon: a **¬±œÄ phase flip** occurring precisely at the non-trivial zero.  
This jump is instantaneous ‚Äî and **invisible** on the critical line due to symmetry.

---

![œÉ=0.501](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.501.png)  
*Figure: œÉ = 0.501, t = 14.135 ‚Äî slightly off the critical line*

A tiny shift in œÉ reveals the internal dynamics.  
The flip becomes visible: the phase begins to drift, rotates, and sharply inverts near the zero.

---

![œÉ=0.499](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.499.png)  
*Figure: œÉ = 0.499, t = 14.135 ‚Äî mirrored case*

Exactly the same mirrored phenomenon occurs.  
This observation forms the structural basis of our phase-based approach.

### üåå OOL-pi-gravity-01: Zero Point Attraction (Zero Gravity)

![Phase spectrum](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-v6-rainbow-both-t=0-35.png)

In this plot, œÉ ranges from 0.1 to 0.9.  
You can see how, **away from the critical line**, the phase ‚Äúgravitates‚Äù toward non-trivial zeros,  
revealing a synchronized rotational behavior ‚Äî irregular, yet strikingly ordered.

This hints at a hidden **attraction mechanism** centered at each zero point.

---

### üîÅ ZPH-ZSG: Zero Point Logarithmic Spiral ‚Äî Vector Sum = 0

![Spiral plot](./src/py/graph/riemann_zeta_spiral-v1-t=14.13473.png)  
*Figure: œÉ = 0.5, t = 14.135 ‚Äî non-trivial zero*

We visualize the infinite vector sum:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} e^{-it \log n}
$$

The real and imaginary parts of these rotating vectors interfere in a delicate way ‚Äî  
**perfectly canceling out at the zero**, forming a **logarithmic spiral that collapses back to the origin**.

> A non-trivial zero is **the only structural node** where oscillations can cancel **completely and symmetrically**.
