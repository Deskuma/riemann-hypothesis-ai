# AI & Human Collaboration: Riemann Hypothesis Exploration

![plot of zeta function](experiments/RZF-plot-demo-v1-2k1k.png)

This project is an experiment in using AI to assist in mathematical exploration, specifically focused on the **Riemann Hypothesis**. The goal is not just to prove a theorem, but to explore **how AI and human intuition can work together** to tackle complex mathematical problems.

## **IMPORTANT WARNING**

- This repository contains **spoilers** for the Riemann Hypothesis.
- Any mathematicians who dislike generative AI should leave this page immediately.
- It's dangerous. I don't want to spoil your pure enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- You solve it yourself. One of the answers is here. Do not view until you give up!

## Overview

The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, with profound implications for number theory and beyond. This project aims to explore the Riemann Hypothesis using a combination of AI-assisted mathematical analysis and human intuition.

## Features

- **Symbolic Computation:** AI-assisted equation transformations.
- **Prime Analysis:** Custom Python tools for prime number distributions.
- **Riemann Zeta Function:** Experimental numerical and symbolic calculations.

## Structure

- `src/` - Python scripts for mathematical analysis.
- `proof/` - Formal proof and explanation.
- `experiments/` - Data logs and visualization.
- `docs/` - Methodology and AI-assisted exploration details.

## Why?
>
> "Mathematics is not just about the answers, but about the journey to find them."

This repository serves as a **testament to AI-assisted mathematics**, demonstrating that **even unsolved problems like the Riemann Hypothesis can be approached in novel ways**.

## Documentation
