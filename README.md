This project is an experiment in using AI to assist in mathematical exploration, specifically focused on the **Riemann Hypothesis**. The goal is not just to prove a theorem, but to explore **how AI and human intuition can work together** to tackle complex mathematical problems.

## **IMPORTANT WARNING**

- This repository contains **spoilers** for the Riemann Hypothesis.
- Any mathematicians who dislike generative AI should leave this page immediately.
- It's dangerous. I don't want to spoil your pure enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- You solve it yourself. One of the answers is here. Do not view until you give up!

## Overview

The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, with profound implications for number theory and beyond. This project aims to explore the Riemann Hypothesis using a combination of AI-assisted mathematical analysis and human intuition.

## Features

- **Symbolic Computation:** AI-assisted equation transformations.
- **Prime Analysis:** Custom Python tools for prime number distributions.
- **Riemann Zeta Function:** Experimental numerical and symbolic calculations.

## Structure

- `src/` - Python scripts for mathematical analysis.
- `proof/` - Formal proof and explanation.
- `experiments/` - Data logs and visualization.
- `docs/` - Methodology and AI-assisted exploration details.

## Why?
>
> "Mathematics is not just about the answers, but about the journey to find them."

This repository serves as a **testament to AI-assisted mathematics**, demonstrating that **even unsolved problems like the Riemann Hypothesis can be approached in novel ways**.

### Riemann Hypothesis Overview

The Riemann Hypothesis states that:

$$
\forall s \in Z,\quad \mathrm{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

##### **Historical Context**
>
> The Riemann Hypothesis was first proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. It remains one of the deepest unsolved problems in mathematics, deeply connected to the distribution of prime numbers, with implications across various fields of mathematics and physics.
> The project aims to leverage AI's capabilities to explore this hypothesis, providing a unique perspective on a century-old problem.

##### **Disclaimer**
>
> This project is an experimental exploration of the Riemann Hypothesis using AI. The results and conclusions drawn from this project are not definitive proofs but rather a collaborative effort to understand the complexities of the hypothesis. The authors do not claim to have solved the Riemann Hypothesis, and this work should be viewed as a step in the ongoing exploration of this mathematical enigma.

##### 🤡 Joke

This project is mathematics as a game.

I've spent over 60,000 hours playing games in my life.
Eventually, I got bored of fictional mechanics and decided to play with the Riemann Hypothesis instead.

This is what happens when you treat prime numbers like enemy spawn points and zeros like frame-perfect dodge windows.

Please enjoy responsibly.

###### The origin of the world

$$
\text{HopeSeed} = \sqrt[|r|]{g^s}, \quad
s = \frac{2 i \pi |x|}{\log(g)}
$$

$r$ is the distance, $g$ is a constant of the world, and $x$ is the position of the observer.
