# AI & Human Collaboration: Riemann Hypothesis Exploration

This project is an experiment in using AI to assist in mathematical exploration, specifically focused on the **Riemann Hypothesis**. The goal is not just to prove a theorem, but to explore **how AI and human intuition can work together** to tackle complex mathematical problems.

## Features
- **Symbolic Computation:** AI-assisted equation transformations.
- **Prime Analysis:** Custom Python tools for prime number distributions.
- **Riemann Zeta Function:** Experimental numerical and symbolic calculations.

## Structure
- `src/` - Python scripts for mathematical analysis.
- `proof/` - Formal proof and explanation.
- `experiments/` - Data logs and visualization.
- `docs/` - Methodology and AI-assisted exploration details.

## Why?
> "Mathematics is not just about the answers, but about the journey to find them."

This repository serves as a **testament to AI-assisted mathematics**, demonstrating that **even unsolved problems like the Riemann Hypothesis can be approached in novel ways**.
