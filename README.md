## ‚ú© WARNING ‚ú©

- This repository contains many **spoilers** related to the famously unsolved Riemann Hypothesis.
- Scholars who dislike or distrust IT and generative AI should **leave immediately for their own safety**.
- We do not intend to interfere with the joy of **pure discovery** cherished by devoted mathematicians.
- The highest bliss lies in solving truth with one‚Äôs own mind and experiencing the world‚Äôs truths firsthand.
- Here we present *an example of one possible answer* ‚Äî but do not read further until you've exhausted your own journey.

## Overview

The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, influencing number theory and many other domains.

This project explores the **mysteries of mathematics and number theory** with a focus on the Riemann Hypothesis, combining AI-assisted analysis with human imagination and intuition. Our aim is to uncover its **deep structural truths**.

## Introduction

The Riemann zeta function Œ∂(s), a complex-analytic function, is a fundamental tool to probe the inner structure of numbers.

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of Œ∂(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This has profound implications in number theory, cryptography, and other mathematical and physical sciences.

The non-trivial zeros of the zeta function correspond to the distribution of prime numbers, forming the central pillar of the Prime Number Theorem.

## Selected Highlights from the Research

### OOL-pi-jump-00: Zero Point Phase Inversion ( $¬±œÄ$ Jump )

<div style="text-align: center;">

![alt](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.50.png)
figure. ool-pi-jump-0#0
œÉ=0.500, t=14.135 non-trivial zero point
</div>

*Note: The Z-shape occurs because the top and bottom are connected. Please imagine this graph as unrolling a cylindrical surface.*

This graph represents observations at the critical line (Re(s) = 1/2). At first glance, nothing seems to change. However, it actually depicts a phase inversion at a non-trivial zero of the zeta function. The curve is smooth (though nonlinear), showing a seamless transition. Internally, the zeta function undergoes a phase shift of $¬±œÄ$ at these points.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![alt](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.501.png)

figure. ool-pi-jump-00#1
œÉ=0.501, t=14.135 non-trivial zero point
</div>

Here is the evidence. At œÉ=0.501, the phase shift becomes visible over time near the zero point, revealing the phase inversion more clearly. On the critical line, this inversion occurs instantaneously, rendering it unobservable.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![alt](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-sigma-v0-s=0.499.png)

figure. ool-pi-jump-00#2
œÉ=0.499, t=14.135 non-trivial zero point
</div>

The same applies to œÉ=0.499. This phase inversion near the zero point is one of the core phenomena we are currently investigating in detail.

### OOL-pi-gravity-01: Zero Point Gravity

<div style="text-align: center;">

![alt](./src/py/graph/arctan_zeta_plot-v6-rainbow-both-t=0-35.png)

figure. ool-pi-jump-00#2
œÉ=0.1~0.9 step 0.1, t=14.135 ~ 32.935 non-trivial zero points
</div>

This graph shows behavior near non-trivial zeros outside the critical line (œÉ ‚â† 0.5).

The internal argument (phase) of the zeta function outside the critical line behaves like it's being pulled toward the zero points, revealing a unique and irregular phase inversion. This suggests a kind of **attraction** structure at the zeros, even from the outside. Why does this happen? Even off the critical line, zero points emerge as structural beacons.

### ZPH-ZSG: Zero-Vector Spiral Game (ZSG: Zero Sum Game)

<div style="text-align: center;">

![zero vector spiral](./src/py/graph/riemann_zeta_spiral-v1-t=14.13473.png)

figure. ZSG-ZSG-01#1
œÉ=0.5, t=14.135 non-trivial zero point
</div>

At this non-trivial zero of the zeta function (Re(s)=1/2, t=14.135), we visualize the cancellation of the following infinite vector sum:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} e^{-it \log n}
$$

Here, vector angles and magnitudes interfere perfectly, ultimately canceling to zero. This is the hallmark of a zero point: **a structurally symmetric node born from pure oscillation**.

### Riemann Hypothesis Summary

Riemann wrote:
> *"All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line."*

$$
\forall \rho \in \mathbb{C},\quad
(\zeta(\rho)=0\ \wedge\ 0<\mathrm{Re}(\rho)<1)
\Rightarrow \mathrm{Re}(\rho)=\frac{1}{2}
$$
