# riemann-ai-exploration
This project is an experiment in using AI to assist in mathematical exploration, specifically focused on the **Riemann Hypothesis**. The goal is not just to prove a theorem, but to explore **how AI and human intuition can work together** to tackle complex mathematical problems.
