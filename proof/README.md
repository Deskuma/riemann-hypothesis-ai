### **ðŸ“– Overview**

> **Can a non-mathematician, with the help of AI, approach the truth behind the Riemann Hypothesis?**

This repository documents an experimental and structural approach to the Riemann Hypothesis developed through iterative dialogue between a human and AI.
By transforming the Euler product of the zeta function into a model of phase interference, this project offers a constructive explanation for why all non-trivial zeros appear **only on the critical line** $\mathrm{Re}(s) = 1/2$.

### **Key Concepts:**

- Euler-formulated Zeta Function $\zeta_e(s)$
- Phase interference ($\theta = t \log p$) and periodic cancellation
- Structural explanation of zero formation via synchronized oscillations
- AI-guided formula transformation, hypothesis generation, and validation

### **Results:**

- Visualization of periodic zero crossings
- High accuracy reproduction of known zeros by $\zeta_e(s)$
- Faster-than-traditional zero region prediction
- Interpretive proof strategy consistent with the Riemann Hypothesis

### **Why This Matters:**

This project shows that **with curiosity, structured thinking, and AI**, anyoneâ€”regardless of academic backgroundâ€”can contribute to profound mathematical questions. It is a prototype for a new kind of knowledge exploration: collaborative, transparent, and open to all.
