## **1. Separation into Even and Odd Functions**

When the terms of the Riemann zeta function are explicitly decomposed into their real and imaginary components, we obtain two separate oscillatory functions:

- **Real Component (Even Function Contribution):**

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(b\ln n)}{n^a} = 0
$$

- **Imaginary Component (Odd Function Contribution):**

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(b\ln n)}{n^a} = 0
$$

For a **zero of the zeta function to exist**, both summations must simultaneously be zero.

## **2. Critical Insight: Why This Leads to $\mathrm{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$**

The key observation is that the two decomposed functions exhibit the properties of an **even function** (cosine term) and an **odd function** (sine term), respectively.

- A zero of $\zeta(s)$ occurs **only when both functions vanish at the same point**.
- This means we must find the only location where an **even function and an odd function simultaneously equal zero** while maintaining the structural integrity of the infinite summation.

We propose that this condition is met **exclusively at $\mathrm{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$** and not at any other value.

---

## **3. Relationship to the Functional Equation**

A deeper reason for this restriction lies in the **functional equation of the Riemann zeta function**:

$$
\zeta(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right) \Gamma(1-s) \zeta(1-s).
$$

This equation inherently **symmetrizes the zeta function about the critical line $\mathrm{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$**.

- The transformation $s \leftrightarrow 1 - s$ ensures that the **structure of zeros is mirrored across this line**.
- This suggests that **the real and imaginary components of the zeta function only synchronize their oscillations at this critical symmetry axis**.

---

## **4. Final Proof Strategy**

To rigorously confirm this conclusion, we must establish the following:

1. **Synchronization of oscillatory phases**:
   - Show that at $\mathrm{Re}(s) = 1/2$, the periodic behavior of the cosine and sine terms aligns in such a way that their infinite summations vanish simultaneously.

2. **Non-existence of zeros outside the critical line**:
   - Demonstrate that at $\mathrm{Re}(s) \neq 1/2$, this synchronization fails, preventing both summations from reaching zero simultaneously.

This approach directly ties the **structure of zeta function zeros** to the fundamental symmetries present in its functional equation.

---

## **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**

The outlined approach provides a structured path toward proving the **Riemann Hypothesis**.

- The decomposition into even and odd functions allows for an independent analysis of the **real and imaginary components of $\zeta(s)$**.
- The functional equation provides an inherent **constraint that forces zero alignment to occur only on the critical line**.

To finalize this proof, we need to **mathematically formalize** the phase synchronization argument and establish a contradiction for off-critical-line zeros.
