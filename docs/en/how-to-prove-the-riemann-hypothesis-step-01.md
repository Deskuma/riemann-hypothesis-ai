## Riemann Zeta Function Decomposition

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

### **1. Expansion of the Zeta Function Terms**

To begin the proof, let us focus only on the terms in the Riemann zeta function:

$$
\frac{1}{n^s}, \quad s = a + bi
$$

Here, $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

Expanding directly, we obtain:

$$
\frac{1}{n^{(a+bi)}}
$$

This expression can be rewritten using the properties of exponents:

$$
n^{(a+bi)} = n^a \cdot e^{(bi \cdot \ln(n))}
$$

or This expression can be rewritten using Euler's formula:

$$
n^{(a+bi)} = n^a \left( \cos(b \ln n) + i \sin(b \ln n) \right)
$$

Therefore, the zeta function terms can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{1}{n^{(a+bi)}} = \frac{1}{n^a \left( \cos(b \ln n) + i \sin(b \ln n) \right)}
$$

This formulation reveals the real and imaginary components of each term in the zeta function:

$$
\Large
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^a \left( \cos(b \ln n) + i \sin(b \ln n) \right)}, \quad s = a + bi
$$

By replacing $a$ and $b$ with $\sigma$ and $t$, we can interpret this in terms of **focus** and **time**—where $\sigma$ represents the focal depth (what part of the number world you’re looking at), and $t$ captures the temporal phase (when you are observing it).

$$
\Large
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^\sigma \left( \cos(t \ln n) + i \sin(t \ln n) \right)}, \quad s = \sigma + i t
$$

### **2. Separation into Real and Imaginary Components**

We now decompose this into its real and imaginary parts:

- **Real part:**

$$
\Large
\Re \left( \frac{1}{n^{a+bi}} \right) = \frac{\cos(b \ln n)}{n^a}
$$

- **Imaginary part:**

$$
\Large
\Im \left( \frac{1}{n^{a+bi}} \right) = -\frac{\sin(b \ln n)}{n^a}
$$

---

With this, we can now observe the **real** and **imaginary** components separately.
Both $a$ and $b$ are shared parameters in these expressions.

---

If we substitute $\mathrm{Re}(s) = 1/2 \rightarrow a = 1/2$ into this equation, there exists a $"b"$ where the difference in argument between the even function and the odd function is exactly $"\pi"$. This is a non-trivial zero point.

## **Explanation**

Rewriting the given expression, a single term of the Riemann zeta function:

$$
\frac{1}{n^s}, \quad s = a + bi, \quad a, b \in \mathbb{R}
$$

can be separated into real and imaginary parts as follows:

$$
\frac{1}{n^{a+bi}}
= \frac{1}{n^a} \cdot \frac{1}{n^{bi}}
= \frac{1}{n^a} \cdot e^{-bi\ln(n)}
= \frac{1}{n^a}\left(\cos(b\ln n) - i\sin(b\ln n)\right)
$$

More explicitly, this leads to the following decomposition:

### **Real Part**

$$
\Re\left(\frac{1}{n^{a+bi}}\right) = \frac{\cos(b\ln n)}{n^a}
$$

- The term $n^a$ causes the amplitude of each term to decrease rapidly as $a$ increases.

### **Imaginary Part**

$$
\Im\left(\frac{1}{n^{a+bi}}\right) = -\frac{\sin(b\ln n)}{n^a}
$$

- Similar to the real part, the imaginary part also exhibits an oscillatory behavior modulated by the decaying factor $\frac{1}{n^a}$.

### **Key Insights from This Decomposition**

- Both the real and imaginary parts contain oscillatory functions ($\cos, \sin$), meaning that each term exhibits periodic behavior determined by $\ln(n)$.
- The exponential factor $\frac{1}{n^a}$ controls the decay rate. The larger the real part $a$, the faster the terms approach zero; the smaller $a$, the slower the decay.

Thus, each term in the zeta function can be seen as part of an **infinite series of exponentially decaying oscillations**.
When the Riemann zeta function is extended into the complex domain, understanding the behavior of these decaying oscillatory components becomes essential in analyzing the location of its nontrivial zeros.

### **Why This Leads to a Hard Problem**

This decomposition helps explain why solving the Riemann Hypothesis remains so difficult.

At the level of individual terms, each component follows a **simple exponential decay and periodic oscillation**. However, the challenge lies in analyzing the **infinite sum of such terms** and understanding where their total sum becomes exactly zero.

The zeros of the zeta function occur at points where the infinite series of terms **perfectly cancel each other out**.
While the behavior of each term is straightforward, **the collective interactions of all terms make the problem highly complex**. This interplay is what makes determining the precise locations of the zeros particularly difficult.
